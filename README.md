# Modern Rotation Control

This is a clone of [Crape's Myrtle Rotation Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.crape.rotationcontrol&hl=en) rewrote from scratch, but heavily inspired (from design to features).

The only major difference is that I do not include the app's icon at the very left of the notification as starting Android 14, custom notification layouts are heavily restricted.

## Reason

I mostly did it for myself as a fun challenge, but I will mostly be the only one using it.
